## Introduction

This is a code project for Shanghai Jiao Tong University CS1207 Program Design and Data Structure III for John Class. In this project you will build 2 different Gomoku AI using the framework we provide. This project includes:

* You will learn about the basic methods to build AI for chess games based on tree search algorithms.
* You will have a basic understanding on modern AI algorithms based on Reinforcement Learning and Deep Neural Networks.
* For students in John Class, you can get familiar with Python and learn about Pytorch in this project.

This project should not demand for a specific development environment, you can freely choose Windows or Linux.

For more Details, please refer to the handout we provide.

\[Notice\]: For John Class students, any plagiarism or sharing of code is not allowed.
